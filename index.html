    The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) is a large, white owl of the typical owl family. Snowy owls are native to Arctic regions in North America and Eurasia. Males are almost all white, while females have more flecks of black <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" target = "_blank">plumage</a>. Juvenile snowy owls have black feathers until they turn white. The snowy owl is a <a class = "subReference" href = "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest#Ground_and_mound_nests" target = "_blank">ground nester</a> that primarily hunts rodents and waterfowl, and opportunistically eats carrion. Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is active during the day, especially in the summertime.

    The snowy owl is typically found in the northern circumpolar region, where it makes its summer home north of latitude 60Â° north. However, it is a particularly <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad" target = "_blank">nomadic bird</a>, and because population fluctuations in its prey species can force it to relocate, it has been known to breed at more southerly latitudes. During the <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period" target = "_blank">last glacial period</a>, there was a Central European subspecies, Bubo scandiacus gallicus, but no modern subspecies are recognized.
    Snowy owls nest in the Arctic tundra of the northernmost stretches of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Eurasia. They winter south through Canada and northern <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" target = "_blank">Eurasia</a>, with irruptions occurring further south in some years. Snowy owls are attracted to open areas like coastal dunes and prairies that appear somewhat similar to tundra. During irruption years when they are found in the Northeastern US, juveniles frequent developed areas, as well as the expected grassland/agricultural areas that older birds primarily utilize. All ages spend a fair amount of their time over water in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean, mostly on <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_floe" target = "_blank">ice floes</a>.

      When perched Snowy owls often face the sun, which has been suggested to represent a visual display across long distances in open habitats. However, snowy owls appear to orient themselves into the sun or wind depending on prevailing weather conditions, therefore it is likely that wind and sun-orientating are associated with <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation" target = "_blank">thermoregulation</a>.

  <p class = "info-container">
      Snowy owls defend nests against Arctic foxes, corvids and swift-flying jaegers; as well as dogs, gray wolves, and avian predators. Males defend the nest by standing guard nearby while the female <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation" target = "_blank">incubates</a> the eggs and <a class = "subReference" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood" target = "_blank">broods</a> the young. Both sexes attack approaching predators, dive-bombing them and engaging in distraction displays to draw the predator away from a nest.

  <p class = "info-container">
      After being considered of least concern by the IUCN since 1988, the snowy owl was upgraded to a conservation status of vulnerable in 2017. Previous population estimates of about 200,000 individuals are now regarded as substantially overestimated, and a total population size of 28,000 individuals is thought to be more realistic.
